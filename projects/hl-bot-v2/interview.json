      "content": "Got it — a Hyperliquid Trading Bot Suite. That's a solid project. Hyperliquid's API is pretty developer-friendly, so there's good potential here.\n\nLet me ask a few questions to nail down the scope:\n\n**First question:** What's the core functionality you're aiming for?\n\nFor example:\n- **Market making** (providing liquidity, earning spread)\n- **Signal execution** (executing trades based on external signals/alerts)\n- **Automated strategies** (grid trading, DCA, momentum, etc.)\n- **Portfolio management** (rebalancing, position monitoring)\n- **Something else entirely?**\n\nAnd is this a single focused bot or genuinely a \"suite\" of multiple tools working together?"

      "content": "HL-MCP: Hyperliquid Trading Bot + Visual Backtester\n\n  What it does\n\n  An automated crypto/commodities trading system that:\n\n  1. Analyzes price action across multiple timeframes (4H, 1H, 30M, 15M, 5M) using a Don Vo / ControllerFX-inspired strategy — no indicators, pure price action (market structure, support/resistance, candle patterns, liquidity sweeps)\n  2. Generates trade signals when all timeframes align — e.g., 4H is bullish, 1H pulled back to demand, 15M shows an LE (liquidity-to-entry) candle pattern at support\n  3. Manages trades with multi-TP exits (TP1 at 1R, TP2 at 2R), stop loss, breakeven trailing, and momentum-based exits\n  4. Backtests the strategy on historical data with a visual replay dashboard — TradingView-style charts that stream candle-by-candle so you can watch the bot \"think\" in real time\n  5. Connects to Hyperliquid DEX via MCP (Model Context Protocol) for live/paper trading\n\n  Data flow\n\n  1. Historical OHLCV data (CSV from TradingView exports or Hyperliquid API)\n  2. Backend streams one candle at a time through the strategy engine\n  3. State updates (candles, signals, trades, portfolio) sent to frontend via WebSocket\n  4. Frontend renders live charts with trade markers, price lines, equity curve\n  5. User controls playback (play/pause/step/speed/seek to date)\n\n  Key strategy concepts\n\n  - Market cycles: Drive → Range → Liquidity (each timeframe classified)\n  - Confluence: Higher timeframes set bias, lower timeframes find entries\n  - Entry types: LE candle, small wick, steeper wick, celery play\n  - Setup types: Breakout, fakeout, onion (range extremes)\n  - Risk: 2% per trade, position sized to stop loss distance"

      "content": "This is a meaty project — essentially a full trading system with a visual backtester and live execution. The Don Vo / ControllerFX price action approach is interesting (market structure over indicators). I can see the vision.\n\nA couple of clarifying questions:\n\n**1. What's the MVP priority?**\n\nThis has three major components:\n- **Strategy engine** (the price action analysis + signal logic)\n- **Visual backtester** (the TradingView-style replay dashboard)\n- **Live trading** (Hyperliquid MCP integration)\n\nWhich do you want working *first*? My guess: strategy engine → backtester → live trading. But maybe you already have parts of this?\n\n**2. Tech stack preferences?**\n\nAny constraints on:\n- **Language** — Python (faster to prototype), TypeScript/Node (unified with frontend), Rust (performance)?\n- **Frontend** — React? Something else? Or are you open?\n- **Charting library** — Lightweight-charts (TradingView's open-source lib), custom canvas, etc.?\n\n**3. The MCP angle** — are you planning to have Claude (or another LLM) orchestrate trades via MCP tools, or is \"MCP\" here just referring to a general protocol/interface pattern you want to follow?"

      "content": "So the first one: What's the priority? The guess is correct, so strategy engine, backtester, live trading. I don't have any parts of this. This will be a fresh project. What I want to have a system which I can basically feed YouTube videos or playlists or PDFs into, and the system will process the content both visually and textually and then, based on that, create a strategy. It will then use data from or candlestick data from TradingView and Hyperliquid to use to do back testing on a tradingview like replay feature. Then, at the same time when the backtesting is happening, you have to continuously learn which part of the strategy actually works, why it works, and also write out what worked, what didn't work.\n\nBasically, the next time the system detects that trade, it has to apply those learnings to that one. Over time, as it does backtesting with more and more data, it learns to pinpoint the perfect execution for a given strategy so that the win rate could be really, really high. And since this entire strategy is based on candlestick patterns, the system must be able to process longer-term candlestick pictures, or it has to be able to build up the data over time. Basically, it is storing all of the data of the candles in some form, a database, or basically caching the data. Over time, it can build out its own sort of a candlestick system, which it can screenshot and draw support and resistance lines on, off of which to do trading decisions, so setting TP's, SL's, break-even, whatever. And even all of the trades that it's doing on the replay-like feature have to be logged, and I have to be able to see them and the decisions behind it. \n\nRegarding the tech stack, I would like you to choose what you believe is the best option. There are no constraints, but Python would likely be the easiest choice.\n\nThe only requirement I have is that I want you to use **SvelteKit** and **Nuxt** for the front end, along with **TradingView's** chart library to build out the candlestick system. \n\nRegarding the LLMs, it's your decision, based on all of this data which I have now given you, to decide where LLMs could be utilized. I do think that LLMs need to be utilized to go through the videos, or go through the texts in the PDF, and also the pictures in the PDF. To understand the strategy in and out"

      "content": "Got it — this is significantly more ambitious than a traditional trading bot. You're describing an **AI-powered trading research & execution system** that:\n\n1. **Ingests educational content** (YouTube, PDFs) → LLM extracts strategy rules\n2. **Backtests with learning loop** — not just testing, but continuously refining *what works and why*\n3. **Builds pattern memory** — stores candle data, learns to identify setups visually, draws S/R, logs all decisions with reasoning\n4. **Self-improves** — each trade informs the next, converging toward optimal execution\n5. **Eventually goes live** on Hyperliquid\n\nThat's a proper AI trading research platform, not just a bot.\n\n**One clarification on frontend:**\n\nYou mentioned both **SvelteKit** and **Nuxt** — these are competing frameworks (Svelte vs Vue). Did you mean:\n- **SvelteKit only** (my recommendation — lighter, faster, pairs well with lightweight-charts)\n- **Nuxt only** (Vue ecosystem)\n- **Both** for different parts? (adds complexity)\n\nWhich do you prefer? Or should I pick one?\n\nOnce you confirm, I'll summarize the full scope and we're ready for planning."
