      "content": "Hey! Excited to help you build this Hyperliquid trading bot suite.\n\nI see you're going for an automated crypto/commodities trading system — solid choice. Hyperliquid's a great venue for this kind of thing.\n\nBefore we dive in, I want to make sure I understand what you're after:\n\n**First question:** What's the core trading strategy or behavior you want this bot to handle? For example:\n- Market making / providing liquidity\n- Trend following / momentum\n- Arbitrage (cross-exchange or funding rate)\n- Portfolio rebalancing\n- Something else entirely?\n\nAnd are you looking to trade perpetuals, spot, or both?"

      "content": "I have built something similar before, this is the general overview:\n\n  An automated crypto/commodities trading system that:\n\n  1. Analyzes price action across multiple timeframes (4H, 1H, 30M, 15M, 5M) using a Don Vo / ControllerFX-inspired strategy — no indicators, pure price action (market structure, support/resistance, candle patterns, liquidity sweeps)\n  2. Generates trade signals when all timeframes align — e.g., 4H is bullish, 1H pulled back to demand, 15M shows an LE (liquidity-to-entry) candle pattern at support\n  3. Manages trades with multi-TP exits (TP1 at 1R, TP2 at 2R), stop loss, breakeven trailing, and momentum-based exits\n  4. Backtests the strategy on historical data with a visual replay dashboard — TradingView-style charts that stream candle-by-candle so you can watch the bot \"think\" in real time\n  5. Connects to Hyperliquid DEX via MCP (Model Context Protocol) for live/paper trading\n\n  Key strategy concepts\n\n  - Market cycles: Drive → Range → Liquidity (each timeframe classified)\n  - Confluence: Higher timeframes set bias, lower timeframes find entries\n  - Entry types: LE candle, small wick, steeper wick, celery play\n  - Setup types: Breakout, fakeout, onion (range extremes)\n  - Risk: 2% per trade, position sized to stop loss distance"

The Don Vo / ControllerFX approach with multi-timeframe confluence is solid, and I like that you've already mapped out the market cycle classifications and entry types.\n\nA couple of clarifying questions:\n\n**1. What's the delta from your previous build?** Are you starting fresh with a cleaner architecture, adding new features (like the MCP integration), or rebuilding a specific piece that didn't work well before?\n\n**2. What's the priority order?** If I had to guess:\n   - A) Core strategy engine (market structure detection, confluence scoring)\n   - B) Backtesting + visual replay dashboard\n   - C) Live trading via Hyperliquid MCP\n   \n   Which piece do you want working *first*? Or do you need them developed in parallel?\n\n**3. Tech preferences?** Any language/framework constraints? (Python for the engine? React/Next for the dashboard? Something else?)"

      "content": "1. Fresh start, let's build this entire system from scratch.\n2. Yes, this looks correct. The stratey engine must be able to digest PDF's, youtube videos/playlists(then transcribe them and then digest the transcript with useful information regarding the strategy) and during the ingestion of the strategy, it needs to also visually analyze the charts on the videos and PDFs as the strategy is price focused and strategy docs show candlestick behavior which is required to make trades\n\nBacktesting feature needs to be like tradingviews replay feature and when creating the visual system, use tradingviews FE library and utilize sveltekit and nuxt. The data will be provided either by me by exporting the data from tradingview (CSV format) or you polling data directly from hyperliquid and caching it.\n\nIdeally I would want the strategy engine developed first as it has many components attached to it. It needs to be able to digest information via text and images AND be able to receive links to youtube videos/playlists, transcribe + capture frames from it with timestamps(basically it needs to understand what the lecturer in the video is saying about the chart at that point in time and how it implements into the strategy) and once ALL of that is done, it needs to run the backtest/walk-forward test from the oldest date point. For each trade it takes, it needs to set TP, SL levels based on the strategy which it has learnt and also explain why it took the trade, what kind of price action it expect, what kind of strategy was it using and basically keep track of the track record of each strategy, and constantly check and improve it's future trades when it's utilizing those trades, basically improving and refining the strategy as it goes along.\n\n3. Tech stack - use what you think is best for this, but ideally Nuxt/SvelteKit for the frontend and Tradingviews library for charts"

Let me make sure I understand what you're actually describing:\n\n**You're not building a bot with coded strategy rules.**\n\nYou're building an **AI system that learns trading strategies from educational content** (PDFs, YouTube videos), then applies what it learned, tracks results per strategy, and self-improves over time.\n\nThat's a fundamentally different beast. Let me confirm a few things:\n\n---\n\n**Clarifying questions:**\n\n**1. Strategy learning engine — what's doing the \"understanding\"?**\n- Are you expecting an LLM (Claude/GPT) to analyze the materials, extract strategy rules, and reason about chart patterns?\n- Or a custom ML model trained on labeled chart data?\n- Or hybrid (LLM for comprehension, custom model for pattern recognition)?\n\n**2. \"Constantly improving\" — what does that mean mechanically?**\n- Reinforcement learning (adjusting model weights based on trade outcomes)?\n- Or more like a knowledge base that logs \"Strategy X failed when Y condition was present\" and the LLM incorporates that context on future decisions?\n\n**3. Video processing at scale — resource constraints?**\n- YouTube transcription + frame extraction + vision analysis per frame = significant compute/API costs\n- Are you budgeting for this, or do we need to be clever about sampling (e.g., key frames only, not every second)?\n\n---\n\n**Updated mental model:**\n\n| Component | What it actually is |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| Strategy Engine | Multimodal AI that ingests educational content (PDF, video), extracts strategy rules, and reasons about price action |\n| Backtesting | TradingView-style replay using their official library, Nuxt/SvelteKit frontend |\n| Live Trading | Executes learned strategies via Hyperliquid MCP, logs reasoning, tracks per-strategy performance |\n| Self-Improvement | Feedback loop where trade outcomes refine future decision-making |\n\nIs that the system you're describing?"

      "content": "Good — now we're cooking. Let me answer #1 and confirm the rest:\n\n---\n\n**1. My recommendation: Hybrid approach**\n\n**Why:**\n- **LLM (Claude) for comprehension** — understands what the lecturer is saying, extracts rules from PDFs, correlates speech with chart frames, builds the knowledge base in human-readable terms\n- **Structured pattern detection engine for execution** — the LLM is too slow/expensive to analyze every candle in real-time. Instead, it extracts rules into a structured format (e.g., \"LE candle = lower wick > 2x body, closes in upper third, at demand zone\"). A fast Python engine then detects these patterns during backtesting/live trading\n- **LLM for trade reasoning** — when a pattern triggers, LLM explains *why* this matches the strategy, what it expects, logs the reasoning\n\nThis gives you the learning capability without burning API credits on every tick.\n\n---\n\n**Confirmed decisions:**\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| Who thinks? | **Hybrid** — LLM for learning/reasoning, structured engine for detection |\n| How does it improve? | **Knowledge base** — in-depth price action logging (what worked, when, why) |\n| Video sampling | **Smart** — 1 frame per 10 sec, dedupe identical frames |\n\n---\n\n**Updated scope:**\n\n1. **Ingestion Pipeline** — PDFs, YouTube (transcribe + sample frames), correlate speech↔charts, extract strategy rules into structured knowledge base\n2. **Pattern Detection Engine** — Python, fast, applies extracted rules to price data\n3. **Trade Reasoning** — LLM explains each trade decision in price action terms\n4. **Knowledge Base** — logs every trade outcome with detailed price action context, feeds back into future decisions\n5. **Backtesting + Replay** — TradingView library, Nuxt/SvelteKit, data from CSV or Hyperliquid polling\n6. **Live Trading** — Hyperliquid via MCP\n\n---\n\n**Ready to proceed to planning?**"
